						The Treaty of Waitangi is an agreement made in 1840 between
						representatives of the British Crown and more than 500 Māori chiefs.
						It resulted in the declaration of British sovereignty over New
						Zealand by Lieutenant Governor William Hobson in May 1840. Most
						chiefs signed a Māori-language version of the treaty. The English-
						and Māori-language versions held different meanings, and Māori and
						Europeans therefore had different expectations of the treaty’s
						terms. Ever since, resolution of these differences has presented New
						Zealand with challenges. <br /><br />

									On 6 February 1840, more than 40 chiefs agreed to sign the
									treaty. The French Catholic Bishop Jean Baptiste François
									Pompallier requested that all religious beliefs should be
									allowed in the new colony, and Hobson agreed to this. In the
									following days, meetings at Waimate North and Hokianga added
									further signatures and marks of agreement to the treaty. This
									agreement was not unanimous, and some chiefs expressed strong
									reservations about signing. Hobson was quick to report to the
									British government that his mission was successful. He noted
									that he had secured agreement to British sovereignty,
									especially from a number of chiefs who had already signed the
									1835 Declaration of Independence, in which 52 chiefs, mainly
									from Northland, had declared their sovereignty over New
									Zealand.

									Before Hobson could collect further signatures he fell
									seriously ill. Two army officers and several missionaries were
									given responsibility for seeking agreement to the treaty
									elsewhere in the country. Several handwritten copies of the
									Māori-language treaty were taken around the country over the
									following seven months. Nine of these copies have survived and
									are under the statutory guardianship and care of Archives New
									Zealand. More than 500 chiefs, including a number of women,
									signed the Treaty of Waitangi. Nearly all signed a
									Māori-language copy. The exception was an English-language
									copy signed by 39 chiefs at Manukau Harbour and Waikato Heads.
									Each treaty copy was also signed by European witnesses who
									varied from place to place.

									Hobson proclaimed British sovereignty over the North Island on
									21 May 1840, basing this on the English text of the Treaty.
									The South Island was also claimed on 17 June 1840, and Stewart
									Island on 5 June 1840, once Treaty signatures had been
									collected from Māori chiefs in some of those areas. Hobson was
									unable to personally make the trip around New Zealand to
									collect signatures to the Treaty because he suffered a stroke.
									He recovered briefly but died in 1842. After the signing of
									the Treaty, there was a huge increase in the number of
									Europeans wanting to buy land and settle in New Zealand.
									Problems arose when new settlers or companies representing
									them tried to buy land without consulting all of the Māori
									landowners. Many Europeans had no understanding of the concept
									of ownership of the land by the tribe. Māori also gradually
									realised that they were not free to sell their land to anyone,
									and that under the terms of the Treaty they could only sell to
									the government,

							<div class="col-sm-6">
								<p class="treatyInfo">
									and not to anyone else if the government did not want to buy
									it. Land sold to the government was sold on to settlers,
									usually at a much higher price than that received by the Māori
									owners. Despite assurances by the British Government that
									Māori people owned all of New Zealand, not just the lands they
									occupied, within a few years the pressure from new settlers
									for land led to the taking of the unoccupied land, described
									as wastelands by the Crown. As settler demand for land grew,
									and it became more obvious that the British expected Māori to
									be subject to British law and authority, tension erupted into
									what is now known as the ‘New Zealand Wars’. The conflict took
									place mainly in Taranaki, Waikato, Hawke’s Bay, and Auckland.
									They were generally fought between 1843 and 1870s with one
									result being that the government confiscated large areas of
									land from the Māori people.

									For nearly 100 years, the signing of the treaty was not
									commemorated. Instead, most celebrations of New Zealand’s
									founding as a colony were marked on 29 January, the date on
									which William Hobson arrived in the Bay of Islands. In 1932,
									Governor-General Lord Bledisloe and his wife purchased and
									gifted to the nation the run-down house of James Busby, where
									the Treaty was signed. It was restored and the first Waitangi
									Day was celebrated in 1934. In 1940, the Waitangi Treaty House
									and grounds featured prominently in the Centennial
									celebrations and annual celebrations were held there during
									the 1950s.

									The Waitangi Day Act was passed in 1960, which stated that 6
									February be set aside to be celebrated throughout the country
									as a national day of thanksgiving to honour the signing of the
									Treaty of Waitangi. In 1974, the day was made a public holiday
									and renamed New Zealand Day but reverted to Waitangi Day in
									1976. From that day, every year on the 6th of February
									ceremonies take place at&nbsp;Waitangi, Northland&nbsp;to
									commemorate the signing of the treaty. Waitangi Day underwent
									'Mondayisation' in legislation enacted in 2013, shifting the
									public holiday to Monday if 6 February falls on a Saturday or
									Sunday.

									In the 1830s an independent, Māori-controlled New Zealand was
									a frontier outpost of the British penal colony of New South
									Wales.&nbsp;As New Zealand’s trade and shipping expanded,
									relations between Māori and Europeans depended on a good
									working accord, but violence sometimes flared up. British law
									did not extend to controlling unruly British subjects in New
									Zealand, so some European residents asked the British
									government to intervene to maintain order. It was reluctant to
									do so. The British government was more concerned by other
									developments. European speculators were reported to have
									purchased vast areas of New Zealand. At the same time the
									London-based New Zealand Company had firm plans for organised
									settlement in New Zealand.

								<p class="treatyInfo">
									In 1839 the company prepared to buy land on either side of the
									Cook Strait, and dispatched ships there carrying several
									hundred settlers. The British government finally decided to
									take action on New Zealand in 1839. It appointed a naval
									captain, William Hobson, as consul to an independent New
									Zealand, and as lieutenant governor to any parts of the
									country that Māori would consent to becoming British. His
									instructions directed him to negotiate for the sovereignty of
									New Zealand, and to establish a British colony.&nbsp;En
									route&nbsp;from Britain Hobson received advice from George
									Gipps, the governor of New South Wales, about drafting a
									treaty with Māori.
